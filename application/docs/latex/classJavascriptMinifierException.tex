\subsection{Detailed Description}
jsmin.php -\/ PHP implementation of Douglas Crockford's JSMin.

This is pretty much a direct port of jsmin.c to PHP with just a few PHP-\/specific performance tweaks. Also, whereas jsmin.c reads from stdin and outputs to stdout, this library accepts a string as input and returns another string as output.

PHP 5 or higher is required.

\hyperlink{classPermission}{Permission} is hereby granted to use this version of the library under the same terms as jsmin.c, which has the following license:
